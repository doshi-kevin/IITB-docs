```tsx:requestSchema.tsx

const requestSchema = new Schema(
  {
    user: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
      required: true,
    },
    message: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    date: {
      type: Date,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  {
    collectionOptions: { changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true } },
  }
);

```
This JavaScript code defines a Mongoose schema named requestSchema for representing requests in a MongoDB database. Each request has fields for user, message, and date. Additionally, it sets up collection options to enable real-time change stream monitoring. The code exports a Mongoose model named Requests based on the defined schema, allowing for interaction with the MongoDB collection representing requests. If the model Requests already exists, it uses the existing model; otherwise, it creates a new one.
