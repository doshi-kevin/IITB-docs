## Functions

```tsx:ibrSchema.tsx

const ibrSchema = new Schema(
  {
    id: {
      type: String,
    },
    additionalFields: {
      type: Schema.Types.Mixed,
      default: {},
    },
  },
  {
    collectionOptions: { changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true } },
  }
);

```

This code defines a Mongoose schema called ibrSchema for an IBR (Interruptible Load) entity, primarily comprising an ID field and additional customizable fields. It supports complex attributes using Schema.Types.Mixed and enables real-time change stream monitoring. The model IBR is exported for database interactions, ensuring consistency in data handling.
