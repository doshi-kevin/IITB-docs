This script defines a Mongoose schema for representing loads in a power system, capturing fields such as ID, device name, power generation values (pMW and qMvar), and additional customizable fields. The schema is configured to enable change stream monitoring for real-time updates. The script exports a model named Load for database operations, facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for loads.
