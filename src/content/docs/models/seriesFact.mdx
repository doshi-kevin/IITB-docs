This script defines a Mongoose schema for representing series facts in a database, storing additional custom fields for each series fact entry. It enables change stream monitoring for real-time updates. The model exported as SeriesFact facilitates CRUD operations on the MongoDB collection, allowing interaction with series fact data.
