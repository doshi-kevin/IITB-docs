## Functions

```tsx:getAllDataRequests

const seriesCapacitorSchema = new Schema(
  {
    id: {
      type: String,
    },
    deviceName: {
      type: String,
    },
    mvar: {
      type: String,
    },
    compensation: {
      type: String,
    },
    additionalFields: {
      type: Schema.Types.Mixed,
      default: {},
    },
  },
  {
    collectionOptions: { changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true } },
  }
);

```

This script defines a Mongoose schema for representing series capacitors in a database, storing attributes like device name, MVAR rating, and compensation details. It includes a field for additional custom fields. The schema is configured to enable change stream monitoring for real-time updates. It exports a model named SeriesCapacitor for CRUD operations, facilitating interaction with the MongoDB collection for series capacitors.
