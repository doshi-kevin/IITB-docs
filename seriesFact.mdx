```tsx:getAllDataRequests

const seriesFactsSchema = new Schema(
  {
    id: {
      type: String,
    },
    additionalFields: {
      type: Schema.Types.Mixed,
      default: {},
    },
  },
  {
    collectionOptions: { changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true } },
  }
);

```
This script defines a Mongoose schema for representing series facts in a database, storing additional custom fields for each series fact entry. It enables change stream monitoring for real-time updates. The model exported as SeriesFact facilitates CRUD operations on the MongoDB collection, allowing interaction with series fact data.
