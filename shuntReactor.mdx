## Functions

```tsx:getAllDataRequests

const shuntReactorSchema = new Schema(
  {
    id: {
      type: String,
    },
    deviceName: {
      type: String,
    },
    busFrom: {
      type: String,
    },
    busSectionFrom: {
      type: String,
    },
    kv: {
      type: String,
    },
    mva: {
      type: String,
    },
    additionalFields: {
      type: Schema.Types.Mixed,
      default: {},
    },
  },
  {
    collectionOptions: { changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true } },
  }
);

```
This code defines a Mongoose schema for representing shunt reactors in a database. It includes fields such as ID, device name, bus from, bus section from, kilovolts (kv), and megavolt-amperes (mva). Additionally, it allows for additional custom fields stored as mixed data types. The schema enables change stream monitoring for real-time updates. The exported model, ShuntReactor, provides an interface for CRUD operations on the MongoDB collection containing shunt reactor data.
