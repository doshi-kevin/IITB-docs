## Functions

```tsx:getAllDataRequests

const shuntFactsSchema = new Schema(
  {
    id: {
      type: String,
    },
    additionalFields: {
      type: Schema.Types.Mixed,
      default: {},
    },
  },
  {
    collectionOptions: { changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true } },
  }
);


```
This code defines a Mongoose schema for representing shunt facts in a database. It includes an ID field and allows for additional custom fields stored as mixed data types. The schema enables change stream monitoring for real-time updates. The exported model, ShuntFacts, provides an interface for CRUD operations on the MongoDB collection containing shunt facts data.
